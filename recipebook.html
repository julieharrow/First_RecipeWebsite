   <img id="image2" class="crop-img" src="img_2.jpg" alt="turkey quinoa meatloaf"/> 
   Time: 80 minutes
   15 Ingredients

INGREDIENTS:
1/4 cup quinoa
1/2 cup water
1 tsp olive oil
1 onions (small, chopped)
1 clove garlic (chopped)
20 ozs ground turkey
1 tbsp tomato paste
1 tbsp hot pepper sauce
2 tbsps worcestershire sauce
1 eggs
11/2 tsps salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
2 tbsps brown sugar
2 tsps worcestershire sauce
1 tsp water

STEPS: 
1. Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan 
   over high heat. 
2. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the 
   quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, about 
   15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
3. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
5. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has 
   softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. 
6. Add the garlic and cook for another minute; 
   remove from heat to cool.
7. Stir the turkey, cooked quinoa, onions, tomato paste, 
   hot sauce, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire, egg, salt, and 
   pepper in a large bowl until well combined.  
8. Shape into a loaf on a foil lined baking sheet. 
9. Combine the brown sugar, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire, 
   and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl. 
10. Rub the paste over the top of the meatloaf.
11. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in 
    the center, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
    inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F. 
12. Let the meatloaf cool for 10 minutes before serving.

    <img id="image3" class="crop-img" src="img_3.jpg" alt="baja fish tacos"/> 
    Time: 40 minutes
    18 Ingredients

INGREDIENTS:
5 cups red cabbage (or one 10-oz bag shredded)
3 tbs purple onion (minced)
1/2 cup chopped cilantro (fresh)
3 tbs cider vinegar
11/2 tsp vegetable oil
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup mayonnaise 
2 tbs lime juice (from one lime)
3 chipotles in adobo (canned, plus 1-2 tsp sauce)
1 large garlic cloves (roughly chopped)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1 cup beer
11/2 lbs cod (skinless, cut into 1-in x 4-in strips)
vegetable oil (for frying)
12 soft corn tortillas (6-inch, warmed)
lime wedges (for serving)

STEPS:
1. Begin by making the slaw, which is a combination 
   of shredded red cabbage, chopped red onions, cilantro, 
   apple cider vinegar, oil and salt.
2. Next, make the chipotle sauce by combining the chipotle 
   peppers in adobo sauce, mayonnaise, lime juice and garlic 
   in a mini food processor or blender. 
3. When youâ€™re ready to fry the fish, prepare the beer batter 
   by whisking together the flour, salt and pepper in a small bowl.
4. Slowly pour in the beer, whisking all the while.
5. Cut the cod into 1-inch wide x 4-inch long strips.
6. Then dip the fish into the beer batter.
7. Pan-fry the fish until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. 
8. When the fish is golden brown, drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
9. Warm up the corn tortillas (I do it in the microwave), then 
   assemble the tacos with a generous amount of chipotle sauce, 
   a heap of cabbage slaw and a piece of crispy cod. Serve with l
   ime wedges, lots of napkins and enjoy!

    <img id="image4" class="crop-img" src="img_4.jpg" alt="coconut cream pie"/> 
    Time: 45 minutes + 3 to 4 hours chilling
    12 Ingredients

INGREDIENTS:
11/2 cups half & half
11/2 cups coconut milk (a little less than 1 can)
2 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup corn starch
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup flaked coconut (toasted)
1 tsp coconut (or vanilla extract)
1 pie shell (9 inch, baked)
1 whipping cream (small carton)
1/8 cup powdered sugar (to taste)
1 tsp coconut extract

STEPS:
1. In a medium saucepan, combine half-and-half, coconut 
   milk, eggs, sugar, cornstarch and salt. 
2. Bring to a boil over LOW heat (using a double-boiler 
   works best), whisking constantly.
3. When it starts to boil a little bit and thickens up 
   to about the consistency of a thick pudding, remove from heat.
4. Stir in 3/4 cup of the coconut and the coconut extract. 
5. Pour into pie shell and chill for 2 to 4 hours, or until firm.
6. While pie is cooling, whip together topping ingredients 
   with electric beaters. 
7. When pie is completely cooled, top with whipped topping and 
   sprinkle on remaining toasted coconut.
